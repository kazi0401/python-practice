    Implement a stack!

    Create a class called Stack with the following methods:
        pop()
            returns the element on top of the stack,
            while also removing it.
            Raises an exception if there is no element left to pop.
            
        push(x)
            add x to the top of the stack.

        peek()
            return the element on top of the stack, without removing it

        is_empty()
            return True if the stack is empty, else False

        size()
            return the size of the stack.

    Do not use any built-in methods that would make this problem trivial.

    Reverse a String II

    Use the stack implementation to reverse a string.

    Balanced Parentheses

    Write a function to check if a string of brackets is balanced.
    Return True if every opening bracket has a closing one, in correct order.

        ([]){} -> True  
        ([)] -> False  
        (((  -> False

    Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

    Write a function that takes in a list and evaluates it in
    Reverse Polish Notation.

    Reverse Polish Notation:
        Operators are followed by their operands
            Ex.
            ['10', '4', '*'] -> 10 * 4 -> 40
            ['2', '1', '+', '3', '*'] -> (2 + 1) * 3 -> 9
            
    The input is a list of strings.
    Each string either represents an integer, or an operator (+, -, *, /)
    Division should be interpreted as integer division (//)
    Don't worry about division by 0.
