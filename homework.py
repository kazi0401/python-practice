    Homework: Tic-Tac-Toe

    Create a class capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
    Ordinary rules apply.

    Requirements:
        Printing the Board:
            Include a way to print the state of the board,
            as if you were actually playing the game.
            
                    |     |
                 X  |  O  | X
               _____|_____|_____
                    |     |
                    |  O  |
               _____|_____|_____
                    |     |
                    |     |
                    |     |
                        
                
        Turn Taking:
            X always starts. Alternate between X's turn and O's turn,
            until there is a winner or until there is a draw.
            Prompt the user's turn however you'd like.
                Hint: coordinates would work,
                      names would work, or whatever else.
                      
        Win Conditions:
            Normal rules apply.
            End the game when a winner is found or if there is a draw.
            Print the result!

        Game-Loop:
            1. Prompt the player to take a turn.
            2. Print the current state of the board.
            3. Prompt next players turn or declare a winner.
