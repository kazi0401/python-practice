    Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

    Write a function that takes in a list and evaluates it in
    Reverse Polish Notation.

    Reverse Polish Notation:
        Operators are followed by their operands
            Ex.
            ['10', '4', '*'] -> 10 * 4 -> 40
            ['2', '1', '+', '3', '*'] -> (2 + 1) * 3 -> 9
            
    The input is a list of strings.
    Each string either represents an integer, or an operator (+, -, *, /)
    Division should be interpreted as integer division (//)
    Don't worry about division by 0.

    Name the function eval_rpn.
